Greetings,

My name is **Richie van der Heij**, a **23-year-old Software Developer** based in the Netherlands. I am currently studying **Creative Media & Game Technologies** at **Hogeschool Rotterdam**, located in Rotterdam.

## **Professional Focus**  
I specialize in **full-stack development**, focusing on building **responsive and scalable web applications**. I work primarily with **Vue 3 (JavaScript)**, **HTML**, **CSS/SCSS**, and **Nest.js**, among other modern frameworks and tools. While I have experience with **PHP**, **Laravel**, and **CodeIgniter 4**, my current focus is on using **Vue 3** for front-end development and **Nest.js** for back-end development.

## **Skills & Technologies**

- **Frontend**:  
  - **Vue 3** (State management with **Pinia**, routing with **Vue Router**)  
  - **JavaScript** & **TypeScript**  
  - **HTML** & **CSS/SCSS** (Using **BEM methodology** for maintainable styling)  
  - **Axios** (For handling HTTP requests and API integrations)  
  - **Figma** (UI/UX design and prototyping)  
  - **Vite** (For fast development builds)

- **Backend**:  
  - **Nest.js** (Building REST APIs, GraphQL, and server-side logic)  
  - **Node.js** & **Express.js** (For server-side JavaScript and real-time applications)  
  - **PostgreSQL** & **MSSQL** (For database management, optimization, and migrations)  
  - **Prisma ORM** (For database management)  
  - **JWT** & **bcrypt** (For secure authentication and password hashing)  
  - **Socket.io** (For real-time communication)

- **Version Control**:  
  - **Git** & **GitHub** (Version control and collaboration)

- **Development Tools**:  
  - **VSCode** (Primary IDE for coding and debugging)  
  - **PHPStorm** (For PHP-related projects)  
  - **pgAdmin 4** (For PostgreSQL management)

## **Development Practices**

- **MVC Architecture**: I apply the **Model-View-Controller** pattern to ensure separation of concerns, which leads to more maintainable and scalable applications.
- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**: I utilize object-oriented principles such as classes, inheritance, and encapsulation to create robust and flexible software.
- **SPA (Single Page Applications)**: I design dynamic and seamless user experiences using **Vue 3** for the front end and **Nest.js** for the back end.
- **BEM Methodology**: I follow the **Block-Element-Modifier** approach for structuring my CSS/SCSS, ensuring scalability and maintainability of the codebase.

## **Collaboration & Opportunities**

I am seeking collaboration opportunities in the following areas:
- **Website Development**  
- **Crypto Business**  
- **Coding Projects** involving a variety of programming languages and technologies.

For inquiries or collaboration proposals, feel free to reach out to me at **Richievanderheij@gmail.com**.
Thank you for considering my profile. I look forward to the possibility of working together on exciting projects.
